## Org

Use org-id for global link UIDs that are not path-dependent.

Treefactor facilitates creating many Org files in deeply nested directories. This can make it challenging to construct an org-agenda files list. See here to load org agenda files recursively: [Recursively adding .org files in a top-level directory for org-agenda-files takes a long time - StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17215868/recursively-adding-org-files-in-a-top-level-directory-for-org-agenda-files-take)

It also helps to have a function that refreshes your org agenda file list, if you've altered paths in that directory.

## Dired

Configure Dired to sort directories before files. You can edit Dired ls switches with dired-sort-toggle-or-edit.

Where possible, capitalize files and directories. This makes it easy to target them with isearch in minimal keystrokes. Omit superfluous extensions to reduce visual clutter with dired-omit-mode.

## Spacemacs

Spacemacs is the best way for beginners to learn Emacs, as it provides powerful user-friendly customizations. Start in Holy mode with Helm.

## Inductive sorting

Treefactor sorting is fast. Think with your fingers, not your brain. You can always redo it later. It is often better to do it wrong and learn something than to sit there just thinking about it. Handling the material improves your feel of the subject. Pretend you're a raccoon rubbing the muck off a squirmy snack pulled from the stream.
