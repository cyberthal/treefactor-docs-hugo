treefactor-org-store-link-fold-drawer is a minor convenience command for org-mode.

Normally, when Org creates a UID link with org-store-link, Org creates a PROPERTIES drawer that displays the UID. This information is not useful for a human to read, and the open drawer takes up several lines of screen space. Folding the drawer manually is a chore. There isn't a way to make Org create the drawer in a folded state. Therefore I wrote this command to do it.

Here's a gif demo:
