org-timestamp-now-inactive inserts an inactive timestamp showing the current time: [2020-01-26 Sun 15:47]

An active timestamp looks like this, and will make its heading appear in the Org Agenda: <2020-01-26 Sun 15:48>

Active timestamps must be limited to avoid clogging the Agenda. However, the only cost of an inactive timestamp is the keystroke to delete it later: <C-S-backspace> kill-whole-line.

Daylogging requires inserting an inactive timestamp after every entry. I bind this command to H-SPC since I use it so often:

#+begin_quote my daylog
wrote documentation page on org-timestamp-now-inactive \\
pondered the meaning of life \\
[2020-01-26 Sun 15:56]

these timestamps barely cost extra effort \\
because they're part of an existing paragraph \\
and Org commands can manipulate paragraphs of arbitrary length \\
thus appending an extra line costs nothing \\

"Know thyself," said Apollo \\ 
Time is the non-renewable resource. \\
What is more essential to self-knowledge, than knowing how one's time was spent? \\
