refresh-org-search-scope removes bad paths from the Org search scope and recursively adds Org files from the designated directories.

If you've changed lots of paths in your Org search scope, then Org probably won't be able to find those files anymore, unless you restart Emacs or run this command.

Here's what it does exactly, step by step:

1. Run clear-org-search-scope.

2. Recursively add the Org files in the treefactor-org-agenda-dir to the variable org-agenda-files.

3. Recursively add the Org files in the treefactor-org-id-extra-dir to the variable org-agenda-text-search-extra-files.
